                <p class="note">"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amzing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and the most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers. working as a Software Engineeer at a VR startup."</p>

                <p class="note" style=" color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%);">"Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programmimg step by step". I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way hat no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experien. I certainly helped me land a job as full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommended! </p>
